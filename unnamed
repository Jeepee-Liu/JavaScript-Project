1. Met TA and discussed the initial setup of the prototype experiment. The UV detection part and the mechanical part is what he was mainly concerned about.
2. Studied hard on the simulation details, especially about multi-phase fluid simulation and parameter sweeping (angular velocity).
3. Worked on the MVR (motor vehicle record) check and got ready for driving to BASF.
4. Performed simulation of different angular velocity. Searched for and got a more accurate formula of shear stress and plotted 2D plot of shear stress vs radius of differnt velocities.
